# BondBridge
BondBridge is an integrated asset library for Glue3D.


Hello devs! If you are here to add to the BondBridge library, go to the Uploads folder and submit a pull request for a folder. 
This folder should be titled with your assets name, have a .txt or .glue3d file in it, and an optional DESC.txt and THUMBNAIL.png.
